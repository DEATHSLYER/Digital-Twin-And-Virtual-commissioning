# Digital-Twin-And-Virtual-commissioning
Developed a high-fidelity Hardware-in-the-Loop (HiL) simulation using Blender and Python-Snap7 to bridge the gap between 3D physics and Siemens S7-1500 PLCs.    Integrated real-time volume-collision sensors and ray-cast distance tracking to validate mission-critical control logic and safety protocols before physical deployment.
